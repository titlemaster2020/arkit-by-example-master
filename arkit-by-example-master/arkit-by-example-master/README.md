## Controls
 - Move around the space to allow the app to first find horizontal planes in the environment
 - Single tap inserts a cube, must tap on a plane.
 - Press and hold on a plane or cube changes the material
 - Two finger press and hold causes a mini explosion

NOTE: Once you have detected the planes you want, disable the plane detection so that the planes don't continue to resize and move around.

NOTE: The thre dots "..." in the bottom right open a settings menu with some debug options.


## Textures
